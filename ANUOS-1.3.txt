3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. 

3.1 Application of License.  

  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
  governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
  Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Software may be
  distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
  of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
  copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
  version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
  License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

3.2 Availability of Source Code.  

  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
  made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
  either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
  Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
  Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
  (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
  least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
  responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
  available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
  maintained by a third party. 

3.3 Description of Modifications.  

  You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to
  contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Software and the date of any change. You must include a
  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
  indirectly, from Original Software provided by the Australian
  National University and including the name of the Australian
  National University in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in
  an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe
  the origin or ownership of the Covered Software. 

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters 

  a) Third Party Claims.  
     If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's 
     intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
     granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
     Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
     distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
     party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient 
     will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
     after the Modification is made available as described in Section
     3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
     copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
     other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
     newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
     the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained. 
  b) Contributor APIs.  
     If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
     interface (API) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses
     which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor
     must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
  c) Representations.  
     Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
     Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
     Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
     Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
     this License. 

3.5 Required Notices.  

  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
  particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
  include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You
  created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
  Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
  where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
  to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
  for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
  more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on
  Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Australian National
  University or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear
  that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
  is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
  Australian National University and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Australian National University or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  terms You offer. 

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.  

  You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Sections 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
  Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of this
  License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
  the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
  included in any notice in an Executable version, related
  documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
  relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable
  version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of
  Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
  provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
  and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to
  limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
  Executable version under a different license You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
  offered by You alone, not by the Australian National University or
  any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Australian
  National University and every Contributor for any liability incurred
  by the Australian National University or such Contributor as a
  result of any such terms You offer. 

3.7 Larger Works.  

  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
  other software not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
  must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
  the Covered Software. 


4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. 

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply
  with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
  (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
  description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
  3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
  Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
  description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
  ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 


5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. 

  This License applies to code to which the Australian National
  University has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related
  Covered Software. 


6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. 

6.1 New Versions.  

  The Australian National University may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
  given a distinguishing version number. 

6.2 Effect of New Versions.  

  Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version
  of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
  that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under
  the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the
  Australian National University. No one other than the Australian
  National University has the right to modify the terms applicable to
  Covered Software created under this License. 


7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 

  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
  IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
  THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL
  UNIVERSITY, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
  ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
  PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 


8. TERMINATION. 

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
    breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly
    granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
    termination of this License shall survive. 

8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
    claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against the
    Australian National University or a Contributor (the Australian
    National University or Contributor against whom You file such
    action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
    a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
       Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
       License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
       prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
       You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
       agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
       Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
       litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version
       against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a
       reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
       agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
       is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
       under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
       expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
    b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
       Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
       Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
       effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
       distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
       Participant.

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
    alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such
    as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
    payment or license.  

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
    which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 


9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
  AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
  DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
  PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
  COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
  DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
  THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
  NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
  SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW
  LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY'S, ITS EMPLOYEES',
  LICENSORS' OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO
  AUD$100. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE SHALL PREJUDICE THE
  STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY DEALING AS A CONSUMER. 


10. MISCELLANEOUS. 

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
  matter hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly
  granted under this License are reserved. Nothing in this License
  shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of the
  Australian National University or any of its Affiliates, even if any
  of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software
  and/or documentation to it. This License is governed by the laws of
  the Australian Capital Territory excluding its conflict-of-law
  provisions. All disputes or litigation arising from or relating to
  this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme
  Court of the Australian Capital Territory. If any part of this
  Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the
  validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid
  and enforceable according to its terms. 


11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 

  As between the Australian National University and the Contributors,
  each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly
  or indirectly, out of its utilisation of rights under this License
  and You agree to work with the Australian National University and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
  basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute
  any admission of liability.


12. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Software as
  "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
  Developer permits You to utilize portions of the Covered Software
  under Your choice of the ANUOS License or the alternative licenses,
  if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
  Exhibit A.
