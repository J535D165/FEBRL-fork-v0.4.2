Data set generation details, PC 29/01/2007
------------------------------------------

Several data set series were being created, all having the same error
characteristics, and all having data sets with sizes (number of
records):

1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, 500,000

The following data set series were created (command line calling of
generate.py program and it's parameters, with X the number of records
as given above):

Deduplication data sets:

1) X/2 original records, X/2 duplicate records, one duplicate per
   original record, maximum 1 modification per duplicate record and
   maximum 1 modification per attribute:

   python generate.py dataset_A_X.csv X/2 X/2 1 1 1 uniform

2) 4X/5 original records, X/5 duplicate records, up to 3 duplicates
   for an original record, maximum 1 modifications per attribute,
   maximum 3 modifications per record, and 'zipf' distribution of
   duplicate numbers.

   python generate.py dataset_B_X.csv 4X/5 X/5 3 1 3 zipf

3) 3X/5 original records, 2X/5 duplicate records, up to 9 duplicates
   for an original record, maximum 3 modifications per attribute,
   maximum 10 modifications per record, and 'zipf' distribution of
   duplicate numbers.

   python generate.py dataset_C_X.csv 3X/5 2X/5 9 3 10 zipf


Linkage data sets:

4) X/2 original records, X/2 duplicate records, one duplicate per
   original record, maximum 1 modification per duplicate record and
   maximum 1 modification per attribute:

   python generate.py dataset_D_X.csv X/2 X/2 1 1 1 uniform

5) 4X/5 original records, X/5 duplicate records, up to 3 duplicates
   for an original record, maximum 1 modifications per attribute,
   maximum 3 modifications per record, and 'zipf' distribution of
   duplicate numbers.

   python generate.py dataset_E_X.csv 4X/5 X/5 3 1 3 zipf

6) 3X/5 original records, 2X/5 duplicate records, up to 9 duplicates
   for an original record, maximum 3 modifications per attribute,
   maximum 10 modifications per record, and 'zipf' distribution of
   duplicate numbers.

   python generate.py dataset_F_X.csv 3X/5 2X/5 9 3 10 zipf


The linkage data sets will then be separated into one file containing
all the original records and the other file all the duplicate records.
File names will be:

  dataset_D_org_X.csv
  dataset_D_dup_X.csv
